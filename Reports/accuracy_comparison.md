## âœ… 4. Confusion Matrix (Decision Tree):
|                 | Predicted No Disease | Predicted Disease |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Actual No Disease |  95                |  5                |
| Actual Disease    |  7                 |  93               |

## âœ… 5. Key Observations:
- The Decision Tree model outperforms the expert system in terms of predictive accuracy and precision.
- The Expert System provides high explainability but lacks adaptability compared to the Decision Tree model.
- Further improvements can be made by combining both approaches or tuning the Decision Tree model more effectively.
