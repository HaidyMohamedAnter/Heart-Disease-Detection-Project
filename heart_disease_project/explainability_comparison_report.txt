EXPLAINABILITY COMPARISON: DECISION TREE VS. EXPERT SYSTEM
======================================================================

1. APPROACH COMPARISON
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision Tree Model:
  - Machine learning approach that automatically derives rules from data
  - Rules are organized in a hierarchical tree structure
  - Rules are derived based on information gain/entropy
  - Top features: thal_2, oldpeak, age, thalach, chol

Expert System:
  - Knowledge-based approach with human-defined rules
  - Rules are organized by risk levels (High, Medium, Low)
  - Rules incorporate domain expertise and medical knowledge
  - Transparent rule-based decision making

2. INTERPRETABILITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision Tree Interpretability:
  - Visual representation shows the decision path for any prediction
  - The path from root to leaf shows exactly which features and thresholds were used
  - The depth of the tree affects interpretability (deeper trees are harder to interpret)
  - Current tree depth: 10

Expert System Interpretability:
  - Rules are explicitly defined in natural language
  - Rules have clear medical interpretations
  - Each rule corresponds to specific medical knowledge about heart disease risk factors

3. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision Tree Accuracy: 0.9902
Expert System Accuracy: 0.4732

4. STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision Tree Strengths:
  - Automatically discovers patterns in data
  - Can find non-obvious relationships
  - Performs well when trained on sufficient data

Decision Tree Weaknesses:
  - May overfit to training data
  - Decision boundaries are axis-parallel (limited expressiveness)
  - Deep trees can be difficult to interpret

Expert System Strengths:
  - Incorporates domain knowledge directly
  - Rules have clear medical rationale
  - Can work with limited data

Expert System Weaknesses:
  - Rules are manually defined and may miss data-driven patterns
  - Requires domain expertise to create and update
  - May not adapt well to new or unusual cases

5. CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The decision tree and expert system approaches offer complementary strengths in heart disease risk prediction:

The decision tree model shows better predictive performance, suggesting it has captured patterns in the data that the expert system rules may not have considered.

A hybrid approach could potentially combine the strengths of both methods:
  - Use the decision tree to identify important features and thresholds
  - Refine expert system rules based on these insights
  - Incorporate rule importance from expert knowledge into tree construction
